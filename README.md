- 👋 Hi, I’m @jdbritton - I'm totally a fox, just look at the profile pic.
- 👀 I’m interested in Python, Powershell, and sometimes Rust. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the above!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on whatever I genuinely feel I can assist with, but I mostly just fool around with code and hack together solutions for my dayjob.
- 📫 How to reach me? You either know, or ya don't. <3 
- Note:
- I am not a pro-developer, my job is not code-related, and I don't upload everything to GitHub. Barely a fifth of my projects/code-kludges end up here, usually hacky stuff!
- So...
- If you want a proper idea of my competence (or lack thereof!) check the Update-SNOW repository.
