- 👋 Hi, I’m @jdbritton - I'm totally a fox, just look at the profile pic.
- 👀 I’m interested in Python, Powershell, and sometimes Rust. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the above!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on whatever I genuinely feel I can assist with, but I mostly just fool around with code and hack together solutions for my dayjob.
- 📫 How to reach me? You either know, or ya don't. <3
